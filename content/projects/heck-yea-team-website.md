# Background

An offshoot of the ECO Auto Solutions brand, Heck Yea! Team, soon called Symphony, is a brand that caters to high-end car owners aged thirty year old and up. With an overall negative perception pervading across the industry, the owners of ECO Auto Solutions seeks to get above that problem and revolutionize the auto repair industry by offering transparent and quality service through their new brand. With that said, they sought out to have their brand kickstarted with a new website quick and fast. Hence, we opted to skip out of intensive research at the beginning and right into prototyping.

# Defining the Brand

<div class="container-fluid">
     <div class="row">
         <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"><img  class="img-responsive rouncorner" src="/projects/heck-yea/heckyea2.jpg"></div>
     </div>
</div>

Once we determined the consumer/user that they were targeting, we sent a list of questions to the brand owner and had them answer a series of question to define their identity better. Afterwards, we determined a list of references for the aesthetic he wanted to achieve, which the owner described to be sleek, bold, sexy, simple, and elegant. From there, we started making the preliminary designs.

# First Design


<div class="container-fluid">
     <div class="row">
         <div  class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"><img class="img-responsive roundcorner" src="/projects/heck-yea/heckyea.png"></div>
     </div>
</div>

After having a preliminary understanding of how the business typically operates, how the brand wants to portray itself, and how people interact with the industry, we set out in designing a prototype that we could release and test with potential users under the target market that they have. At this point, the brand was still temporarily called "The Underdog Project." Considering that the client wanted to rush the work, we skipped low fidelity prototypes and went for mockups.

<div class="container-fluid">
     <div class="row">
    	<iframe  class="adobe-xd col-md-8 col-md-offset-2" width="100%" height="500" src="https://xd.adobe.com/embed/d1d9ffb9-118f-458b-9e84-443cfbc68243" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
     </div>
     <figcaption class="row">"it's scrollable"</figcaption>
</div>


With this being the first draft made, we conducted a few contextual inquiries before showing this to the client. we got positive feedback from younger car owners saying that they would check out and get service from this brand. They were also amused by the tagline. However, after convening with the client, we both acknowledged that this doesn't represent the brand well, especially in content. Hence, we went through a few more iterations between ourselves to refine it for more intensive testing with the affluent car owners he is targeting.

# Agreed Design and Production of Website

     </div>
     <figcaption class="row">"it's scrollable"</figcaption>
</div>


After a total of 6 more iterations with the client, content writing, and observing how auto repair shop conduct operations, my client and we have finally got to this version. From this, our team built a WordPress website  for the company's initial launch exactly to how the client wanted it. All throughout development, the client introduced multiple changes that led him to change the content, the brand name, and the format of the design.

# Testing

After finishing the website, we couldn't find a compromise on the direction of the design. As such, we collected payment, formally closed the project, and conducted research of our own separate from the client's testimonials from his clients. Research was conducted objectively and we were careful enough not to ask leading questions. Here's what we found:

> 1. Users who viewed the site were confused about what service the brand was really offering, implying the content was not cohesive.

> 2. Users were confused by the call-to-action at the end because it did not imply a free consultation with the text in place (can be seen on live website) despite being the destination linked to the "Get Free Consultation" button.

> 3. Users were not able to find what the immediate information they were looking for upon arrival on the page.

> 4. Videos were phrased to be either "out-of-place" or "unnecessary".

> 5. The brand name did not imply anything about the business, the user said.

# Revised Design

After hearing objective criticism, we revised the design to reflect a better user experience, and here's what we came up with.

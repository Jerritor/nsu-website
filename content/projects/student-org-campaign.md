# Defining the Brand

<div class="container-fluid">
     <div class="row">
         <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"><img class="img-responsive roundcorner" src="/projects/tyler-sga/melphoto-min.jpg"></div>
     </div>
</div>

Working with Tyler, who told us that he was a business major, we had him go through our brand familiarization form - which was a list of questions that Tyler had to answer to really define what the identity for his campaign was going to be.

    <a class="btn btn-default btn-template-secondary" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_FrSfuPKli9akxEc0hNMVlpbU0/view?usp=sharing" class="btn">SEE BRAND FAMILIARIZATION</a>
</div>

# Design Studio

<div class="container-fluid">
     <div class="row">
         <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"><img class="img-responsive roundcorner" src="/projects/tyler-sga/designstudio-min.jpg"></div>
     </div>
</div>

After defining what sort of brand voice, Tyler wanted, We immediately went into a design studio where the team individually designed their version of the website. Afterwards, we start commenting on each other designs, pointing out their finer features, and bringing them together to make a final design. From there, we clarified with the client if the final wireframe we made is okay for the next steps.

<div class="container-fluid">
     <div class="row">
         <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"><img class="img-responsive roundcorner" src="/projects/tyler-sga/tyler-highfid.jpg"></div>
     </div>
</div>

We then consolidated each of our designs and voted on aspects that we thought would be key to effectively describing Tyler's campaign. We then made a final paper prototype that Tyler signed off on.

# Agreed Design and Production of Website

From there, we conducted a quick photoshoot for Tyler's website so that we could have a few base assets we can use. And in the end this is what we came up with and had Tyler review:

<div class="container-fluid">
     <div class="row">
        <iframe class="adobe-xd col-md-8 col-md-offset-2" width="100%" height="500" src="https://xd.adobe.com/embed/59545898-c81c-4b19-9de3-4d8eabfff5e8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
     </div>
     <figcaption class="row">"it's scrollable"</figcaption>
</div>

# Current Situation

We then began coding the design into an actual website. It is currently in development.
